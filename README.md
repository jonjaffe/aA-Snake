## Interactive JavaScript App

[Snake](https://jonjaffe.github.io/aA-Snake) is a single-page frontend web app created by Jon Jaffe

The app's core features include:
- 4 levels of challenging snake gameplay
- Updating high score board
- Smooth game styling and CSS effects

## Project Design

The project, which was completed over the span of 4 days, started with drafting a proposal. The proposal included:

* drawing out a game wireframe
* outlining the project timeline


## Technology

Snake uses the following technologies:
    * JavaScript
    * Vanilla JS
    * jQuery

This game was architected with the following scripts, following the principles of Object-Oriented programming:

- `SnakeView` - logic for creating and updating the game
- `Board` - logic for creating, rendering and modifying the board
- `Snake` - logic for creating, moving, and growing snake
- `Food` - logic for creating and replacing food
- `Obstacle` - logic for creating obstacles and instantiating multiples based upon current level

## Future Directions for the Project

There are several directions that this project will take as it continues to move into future stages of implementation

#### ~~Kramer vs~~ Snake vs Snake play

Have two players control their own snakes and race for the food!
